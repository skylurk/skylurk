- Ssup, My developer name is Sky, Sky's the limit and all, a little tacky, but who cares ;)
- I am a javascript enthusiast and love cross platform devs, reason for my crush on Flutter. I like simple so I go Python and can't pass a chance on complex hence C++, Java and c#. Apple's cute, so a little bit of Swift couldn't hurt. Front End rules, that's why React is my cup of tea. 
- I got a big head and room for lots of technologies, why I am learning Vue, Angular and ASP. I know, I am allover the place, but I get really good when I focus on one, depending on the project I am working on. 
- My dreams are big on eCommerce and Fintech, I wouldn't mind some collaboration on these :)
- You can reach me on Whatsapp: +254770054797, that's my phone number too, or drop me an email at skylurkauto@gmail.com
- ❤ Ogis.
